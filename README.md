# vTuber Discord Bot 
JDA Discord Bot Written in Java Maven with various VTuber related features such as schedule checking and music. Currently Nijisanji and Hololive talents are built-in, however adding additional talents is supported.

The bot also shows which streamers are currently live. To make use of this create two text channels called "hololive-live" and "nijisanji-live"

## Building from source
The project should be built as a shaded jar.
